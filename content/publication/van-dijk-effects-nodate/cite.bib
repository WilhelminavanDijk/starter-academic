 abstract = {Promoting meaningful reflection from teacher candidates is an ongoing challenge for many teacher preparation programs. Video-based reflection provides an opportunity for candidates to examine their own teaching more closely as they reflect on their continued growth. This study examined the role of different cameras and camera angles in the reflection process for preservice teachers implementing one-on-one reading tutoring sessions. In particular, we were interested in whether using video from head-mounted cameras as a basis for reflection activities would have an influence on the focus and type of statements used in reflections. We were also interested in the advantages and disadvantages of the different cameras from the teacher candidates’ perspectives. Results indicate that camera type did not influence the focus and type of reflective statements. In general, candidates preferred the traditional camera setup, but the head-mounted camera did offer some advantages. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.},
