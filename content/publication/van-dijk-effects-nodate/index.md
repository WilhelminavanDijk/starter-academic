abstract: Promoting meaningful reflection from teacher candidates is an ongoing challenge
  for many teacher preparation programs. Video-based reflection provides an opportunity
  for candidates to examine their own teaching more closely as they reflect on their
  continued growth. This study examined the role of different cameras and camera angles
  in the reflection process for preservice teachers implementing one-on-one reading
  tutoring sessions. In particular, we were interested in whether using video from
  head-mounted cameras as a basis for reflection activities would have an influence
  on the focus and type of statements used in reflections. We were also interested
  in the advantages and disadvantages of the different cameras from the teacher candidates’
  perspectives. Results indicate that camera type did not influence the focus and
  type of reflective statements. In general, candidates preferred the traditional
  camera setup, but the head-mounted camera did offer some advantages. Implications
  for practice and future research are discussed.
