abstract: Misconceptions about the brain and its relation to education are widespread.
  This can lead to the implementation of ineffective methods and the waste of precious
  resources. To examine the extent of belief in neuromyths, a survey about the brain
  in education was conducted. Respondents (n = 169) came from special education (n
  = 83) and general education (n = 78), and included preservice teachers (n = 34),
  in-service teachers (n = 63), higher education faculty (n = 39), and educational
  leaders (n = 33). The survey contained 15 Myths and 18 Facts, and overall, participants
  were able to correctly identify approximately 66% of all the Facts. On the other
  hand, on average, respondents responded correctly for only one third of the Myths.
  The most commonly misidentified Myths were related to motor coordination exercises
  to improve literacy skills, the right brain-left brain myth, and learning styles.
  Higher education faculty were able to identify more Myths than any other group.
  Implications for teacher preparation and ongoing professional learning for teachers
  and educational leaders are discussed.
