abstract: Oral Reading Fluency (ORF) is a widely-used index of reading ability in
  early elementary grades; however, little information exists on predictive value
  of student characteristics on ORF scores (Wang, Algozzine, Ma, & Porfeli, 2011).
  A three-step sequential model was used to analyze the influence of student characteristics
  on scores (N = 2649) on an end of year ORF measure. Results indicate gender, race,
  lunch status, and English Language Learner status explained 7% of the variance in
  scores after controlling for grade and school characteristics (ΔR2 = .07, F8, 2626
  = 35.93, p = textless .001), and Special Education (SPED) status explained an additional
  5% (ΔR2 = .05 F9, 2625 = 59.45, p = textless .001). The predictive value of several
  student characteristics changed depending on SPED status, and this was also a significant
  moderator on grade level (ΔR2 = .002 F2, 2623 = 4.12, p = .016). The use of these
  results in subsequent research is discussed.
