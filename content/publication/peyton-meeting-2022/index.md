abstract: As part of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act (2007), the USA funded
  the TEACH Grant to incentivize earning a degree in a high-need content area (e.g.,
  STEM fields, language-related areas, and Special Education) and to help meet teacher
  supply needs in low-income schools. Our analysis investigates the impact TEACH has
  had on the production of undergraduate education degrees overall and in high-need
  content areas. Using publicly available datasets and propensity score methods, we
  compare undergraduate education degree production at institutions of higher education,
  making comparisons between adopters and non-adopters of TEACH. Our findings suggest
  the adoption of TEACH had no impact on the overall production of undergraduate education
  degrees or production of education degrees in STEM, language-related fields, or
  special education. We situate our findings in the context of unrelenting demand
  for teachers in the USA.
