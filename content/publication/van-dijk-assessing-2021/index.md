abstract: Complex research questions often need large samples to obtain accurate estimates
  of parameters and adequate power. Combining extant datasets into a large, pooled
  dataset is one way this can be accomplished without expending resources. Measurement
  invariance modeling (MI) is an established approach to ensure participant scores
  are on the same scale. There are two major problems when combining independent data
  sets through MI. First, sample sizes will often be large leading to small differences
  becoming non-invariant. Second, not all datasets may include the same combination
  of measures. In this paper, we present a method that can deal with both these problems
  and is user friendly. It is a combination of generating random normal deviates for
  variables missing completely in combination with assessing model fit using the RMSEA
  good enough principle, based on the hypothesis that the difference between groups
  is not zero, but small. We demonstrate the method by examining MI across eight independent
  data sets and compare the MI decisions of the traditional and good enough approach.
  Our results show the approach has potential in combining educational data.
