abstract: Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is a multitiered system
  of support for behavior used in many schools across the world. Researchers have
  begun adapting and evaluating Tier 1 of PBIS for students placed in alternative
  education (AE) settings. The purpose of this review is to synthesize these evaluations.
  We systematically searched two electronic databases to find potential studies of
  Tier 1 PBIS in AE settings. We screened 47 full texts, 19 of which met all inclusion
  criteria. Most studies (16 of 19, 84%) evaluated student behavioral outcomes, while
  seven studies (37%) evaluated academic outcomes alone or in addition to behavioral
  measures. Overall, restraints and seclusions generally decreased following Tier
  1 implementation, but behavioral incident changes were variable and academic outcomes
  only improved for students enrolled continuously throughout the studies. The findings
  of this review support the need for continued evaluations of Tier 1 in AE settings
  using more rigorous methodologies and metrics that account for rolling admissions.
  The observed reductions in restraints and seclusions are promising for students
  and practitioners given the poor outcomes associated with these consequences.
