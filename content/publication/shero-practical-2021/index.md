abstract: Can genetic screening be used to personalize education for students? Genome-wide
  association studies (GWAS) screen an individualâ€™s DNA for specific variations in
  their genome, and how said variations relate to specific traits. The variations
  can then be assigned a corresponding weight and summed to produce polygenic scores
  (PGS) for given traits. Though first developed for disease risk, PGS is now used
  to predict educational achievement. Using a novel simulation method, this paper
  examines if PGS could advance screening in schools, a goal of personalized education.
  Results show limited potential benefits for using PGS to personalize education for
  individual students. However, further analysis shows PGS can be effectively used
  alongside progress monitoring measures to screen for learning disability risk. Altogether,
  PGS is not useful in personalizing education for every child but has potential utility
  when used simultaneously with additional screening tools to help determine which
  children may struggle academically.
