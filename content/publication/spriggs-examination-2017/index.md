abstract: We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature to establish the evidence
  base for using visual activity schedules (VAS) with individuals with intellectual
  disability. Literature published after 2005 was evaluated for quality using the
  criteria developed by Horner et al.; a total of 14 studies were included as acceptable.
  Findings suggest that VAS is an evidencebased practice for teaching a variety of
  daily living, navigation, vocational, recreation, and academic skills to adolescents
  and adults with intellectual disability. Results also show increases in independence
  and on-task behaviors. We conclude the article by discussing limitations and recommendations
  for future research.
