 abstract = {In this paper, we discuss what heritability is and how it is measured, and explain why estimates of heritability are not always the same in different scientific papers. After providing this foundational knowledge, we bust some common myths about heritability. We end with discussing how teachers can use their knowledge about heritability in their own practice.},
