abstract: In this paper, we discuss what heritability is and how it is measured, and
  explain why estimates of heritability are not always the same in different scientific
  papers. After providing this foundational knowledge, we bust some common myths about
  heritability. We end with discussing how teachers can use their knowledge about
  heritability in their own practice.
