abstract: Randomized control trials are considered the pinnacle for causal inference.
  In many cases, however, randomization of participants in social work research studies
  is not feasible or ethical. This paper introduces the co-twin control design study
  as an alternative quasi-experimental design to provide evidence of causal mechanisms
  when randomization is not possible. This method maximizes the genetic and environmental
  sameness between twins who are discordant on an “exposure” to provide strong counterfactuals
  as approximations of causal effects. We describe how the co-twin control design
  can be used to infer causality and in what type of situations the design might be
  useful for social work researchers. Finally, we give advantages and limitations
  to the design, list a set of Twin Registries with data available after application,
  and provide an example code for data analysis.
