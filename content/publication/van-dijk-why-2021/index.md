abstract: In reading intervention research, implementation fidelity is assumed to
  be positively related to student outcomes, but the methods used to measure fidelity
  are often treated as an afterthought. Fidelity has been conceptualized and measured
  in many different ways, suggesting a lack of construct validity. One aspect of construct
  validity is the fidelity index of a measure. This methodological case study examined
  how different decisions in fidelity indices influence relative rank ordering of
  individuals on the construct of interest and influence our perception of the relation
  between the construct and intervention outcomes. Data for this study came from a
  large State-funded project to implement multi-tiered systems of support for early
  reading instruction. Analyses were conducted to determine whether the different
  fidelity indices are stable in relative rank ordering participants and if fidelity
  indices of dosage and adherence data influence researcher decisions on model building
  within a multilevel modeling framework. Results indicated that the fidelity indices
  resulted in different relations to outcomes with the most commonly used fidelity
  indices for both dosage and adherence being the worst performing. The choice of
  index to use should receive considerable thought during the design phase of an intervention
  study.
