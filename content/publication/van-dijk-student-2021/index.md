abstract: 'Background: For most instruction, there are individual differences in responsiveness,
  resulting in some children benefitting less than others. These child by instruction
  interactions have been shown to exist in reading instruction and interventions through
  cognitive factors. Student behavior, however, may be of influence in response to
  instruction and intervention, since it impedes with students’ ability to focus and
  attend to instruction.Methods: The potential moderation of students’ behavior ratings
  on reading instruction effectiveness was estimated on a data set including 3,024
  students in K-3. Data came from eight independent studies evaluating multi-component
  reading approaches and were pooled using integrative data analysis. We estimated
  the interaction of student behavior ratings on treatment effectiveness both at the
  within and between classroom level.Results: Multicomponent reading approaches were
  effective in improving reading scores (b=0.48, p=.017, d=0.08). However, students
  with behavior ratings outside the average did not benefit from the approaches, while
  students with average ratings did benefit (range of behavior ratings: -1.61 – 0.68).
  At the classroom level, students in classrooms with a lower average of problem behaviors
  did not benefit from these approaches (average classroom behavior rating &gt; -0.14).Conclusions:
  Our findings suggest behavioral characteristics of students are of influence on
  the effectiveness of multi-component reading approaches. In particular, students
  with problem behaviors do not benefit from reading instruction and intervention
  and may need additional supports.'
