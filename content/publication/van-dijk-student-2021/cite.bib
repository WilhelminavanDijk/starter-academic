 abstract = {Background: For most instruction, there are individual differences in responsiveness, resulting in some children benefitting less than others. These child by instruction interactions have been shown to exist in reading instruction and interventions through cognitive factors. Student behavior, however, may be of influence in response to instruction and intervention, since it impedes with students’ ability to focus and attend to instruction.Methods: The potential moderation of students’ behavior ratings on reading instruction effectiveness was estimated on a data set including 3,024 students in K-3. Data came from eight independent studies evaluating multi-component reading approaches and were pooled using integrative data analysis. We estimated the interaction of student behavior ratings on treatment effectiveness both at the within and between classroom level.Results: Multicomponent reading approaches were effective in improving reading scores (b=0.48, p=.017, d=0.08). However, students with behavior ratings outside the average did not benefit from the approaches, while students with average ratings did benefit (range of behavior ratings: -1.61 – 0.68). At the classroom level, students in classrooms with a lower average of problem behaviors did not benefit from these approaches (average classroom behavior rating &gt; -0.14).Conclusions: Our findings suggest behavioral characteristics of students are of influence on the effectiveness of multi-component reading approaches. In particular, students with problem behaviors do not benefit from reading instruction and intervention and may need additional supports.},
