abstract: 'Background: This meta-analysis focused on the teaching of skills to individuals
  with intellectual disability (ID) to maximise independence increase the likelihood
  of full participation in all aspects of life, economic self-sufficiency, and independent
  living. Visual activity schedules (VAS) is an intervention with a growing evidence
  base that focuses on developing independence.Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis
  of VAS effects on independence skills of individuals with ID. Thirteen single-case
  design studies met the meta-analytic inclusion criteria, including evidence of a
  functional relationship via visual analysis. For each graph, three effect size metrics
  were calculated. The overall effect sizes were calculated with a random effect models
  and potential influence of moderators with meta-analytic regression models.Results:
  Results suggest that VAS has a meaningful impact on increasing independent skills
  for individuals with ID with type of instruction the only moderator.Conclusions:
  The results suggest all modes of VAS are likely to yield positive effects across
  age groups, settings, and skills.'
