 abstract = {Implementation fidelity is often thought of as a necessary condition to achieve internal validity and as having a relation to student outcomes. To examine the nature of this relation, we reviewed reading intervention studies for students in K-12 in which measures of implementation fidelity were included in final data analysis. A systematic search yielded 43 studies using mostly measures of dosage, adherence, and quality. A detailed look at the construction of the measures revealed a wide variety of conceptualizations of implementation fidelity, in terms of content, measurement approaches, and variable construction. The relation between implementation fidelity and student outcomes was variable across the studies. In order to better study the relation, we recommend researchers to incorporate measurement of implementation fidelity in the design phase of research projects.},
