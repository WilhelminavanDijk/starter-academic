abstract: Implementation fidelity is often thought of as a necessary condition to
  achieve internal validity and as having a relation to student outcomes. To examine
  the nature of this relation, we reviewed reading intervention studies for students
  in K-12 in which measures of implementation fidelity were included in final data
  analysis. A systematic search yielded 43 studies using mostly measures of dosage,
  adherence, and quality. A detailed look at the construction of the measures revealed
  a wide variety of conceptualizations of implementation fidelity, in terms of content,
  measurement approaches, and variable construction. The relation between implementation
  fidelity and student outcomes was variable across the studies. In order to better
  study the relation, we recommend researchers to incorporate measurement of implementation
  fidelity in the design phase of research projects.
